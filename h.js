Issue that migth be the reason for chash

* Memory issues: If the program is running out of memory or accessing memory that it should not be accessing, 
  it could lead to random crashes. To isolate this issue, I would use a memory profiler to identify any memory leaks or excessive memory usage.

* Thread synchronization issues: If the program is multithreaded and there are synchronization issues with shared resources, 
  it could cause random crashes. To isolate this issue, I would use a thread profiler to identify any race conditions or deadlocks in the code.

* External dependencies: If the program depends on external libraries or resources, they could be causing random crashes.
  To isolate this issue, I would try running the program in isolation, without any external dependencies, to see if the crashes still occur.

* Hardware issues: If the program is running on faulty hardware, it could cause random crashes. To isolate this issue, 
  I would try running the program on different hardware to see if the crashes still occur.

  /* 
Dealing with crashes

To isolate the cause of the random crashes, I would use a combination of debugging tools such as a debugger, profiler, and log files. 
I would also try to reproduce the crashes by running the program with different inputs or under different conditions. 
Once I have identified the potential cause, I would focus on debugging and fixing the specific issue.
